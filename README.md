# OnlyVibes ðŸŽ¶âœ¨  

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview  

This repository contains the first phase of the **OnlyVibes** project, developed as part of a university assignment. The goal of this phase was to **analyze and define user requirements** for a web application of our choice, following a structured methodology taught in the course. This involved identifying **user needs**, specifying **functional and non-functional requirements**, and detailing **user interactions** through well-defined user stories.  

The project was required to include:  
- A detailed breakdown of the **system's capabilities and constraints** ðŸš€  
- User stories that highlight **real-world interactions** with the platform ðŸ“–  
- **Mockups** to visually support the described functionalities ðŸŽ¨  

## ðŸŒŸ Why OnlyVibes?  

We chose to develop **OnlyVibes**, an application designed to provide a unique and engaging experience for users. Unlike conventional platforms, OnlyVibes focuses on a set of core interactions that enhance user engagement and create a dynamic, immersive environment. This choice allowed us to define features that deliver real value while keeping the user experience at the forefront.  

## ðŸ“‚ What Youâ€™ll Find in This Repository  

This repo contains all materials related to the **first phase of the project**, including:  
- **Requirements Analysis**: A structured breakdown of what the application should do and the constraints it must adhere to.  
- **User Stories**: Real-world scenarios describing how users interact with OnlyVibes, covering both happy and unhappy paths.  
- **Mockups**: Visual representations of the core user flows to support the defined requirements.  

This repository reflects our **work-in-progress approach** as we refine and expand the application further. Stay tuned for future updates! ðŸš€
